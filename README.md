# QuizbowlAI
an easier Quizbowl AI opponent for broader audience (nerfed).

#Structure
1) database of Quizbowl questions
2) script for parsing quizbowl csv
3) prompts for LLM to follow
4) terminal app that reads csv, prints out question, allows buzzing of either LLM or person

# Alternate Structure (simpler)
- everything the same except that the LLM would be prompted to answer the question as a selected persone (eg:middle schooler)
- not sure if this would facilitate the question streaming functinoality
