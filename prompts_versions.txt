CHATGPT 1st PROMPT
Prompt:

You are an AI tasked with answering Quizbowl-style questions that are delivered one word at a time. Your goal is to simulate the process of hearing the question gradually and trying to buzz in with the correct answer as early as possible. Here's how you should proceed:



Incremental Chunking: Break the question into sequential chunks. Each chunk should contain a random number of words (between 1 and 5, unless specified otherwise). You must process the question one chunk at a time, always from the beginning.

Running Answer and Confidence: After each chunk, do the following:

Reconstruct the question up to that point (i.e., concatenate all chunks seen so far).

Propose an answer to the question based only on that partial information.

Report your confidence in the answer at that step. Confidence should be one of: Not confident, Somewhat confident, or Very confident.

Termination: Continue until the full question has been revealed, or until you reach a chunk where you are very confident in your answer. At that point, stop and present that as your final answer.

Step N:Chunk: "<words in this chunk>"

Question so far: "<full question so far>"Answer: "<your guess here>"Confidence: <confidence level>

Example:

Given the full question:



"This author of Invisible Man described a paint company that mixes black and white to make 'Optic White.'"

Your output might look like:

This prompt ensures the model simulates the process of buzzing in progressively, while giving definite, confidence-graded answers at each stage. Want me to adapt this for a specific LLM (like Claude, Gemini, or Mistral)?
